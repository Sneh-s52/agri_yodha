Context: --- From Database ---
Detection and inspection Wheat fields can be inspected for all three wheat rusts at any stage of growth; however, a continuous monitoring of fields in disease-prone areas is highly recommended for early detection of disease in order to implement control strategies. Wheat rust diagnosis is primarily based on symptoms. All rust fungi produce uredinia from chlorotic areas after infection on susceptible varieties. The pustules are elongated and yellow to orange, or orange to dark-red in colour. These typical symptoms and signs make wheat rust diseases easily distinguishable from other wheat diseases. The three rusts can be distinguished from each other by the size, shape, colour, and arrangement of uredinia. Generally, the three wheat rust fungi are highly adapted to wheat, and pathogens of stripe and stem rusts on wheat have formae speciales (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. tritici , respectively). That means that the rust isolates collected from wheat are generally wheat rusts. However, the barley stripe rust fungus ( P. striiformis f. sp. hordei ) can sometimes also infect wheat varieties. In such cases, the observed symptoms and collected isolates from wheat could be either wheat stripe rust or barley stripe rust, or both. This is even more complex for isolates collected from alternate hosts. For this situation, the collected isolates must be inoculated on a range of host species for formae speciales identification. Isolates within a forma specialis may have differences in avirulence/virulence profile, and isolates with the same avirulence/virulence profile are often called a race. The avirulence/virulence profile must be identified by testing the isolate on a set of wheat cultivars/lines called differentials. In practice, the differentials exhibit geographical variation based on the local importance of certain resistance genes. Due to rapidly evolving virulence, one thus needs to constantly survey pathogen populations to identify new virulence and monitor its dynamics. Hence, coordinated surveillance is needed across wheat cropping areas to reliably detect, predict and mitigate emerging rust diseases. In addition, long-term monitoring of virulence composition of fungal populations is needed to trace the dynamics of races. This information ultimately informs local and global breeding programmes. Detection of wheat rusts has also benefitted from new genomic approaches, such as field pathogenomics. This approach uses transcriptome sequencing of rust- infected wheat leaves directly from the field, can detect changes in the pathogen population, and anticipate an emerging epidemic. The Mobile And Real-time PLant disEase (MARPLE) diagnostics is another monitoring approach. This near real-time genomics-based point-of-care diagnostic platform has been applied to forecast wheat rust disease risk in Ethiopia. These technologies can help to reduce the impact of wheat rust diseases, but still require conventional avirulence/virulence analyses to update the molecular data. After detection of the presence of the rust diseases, their intensity (for example, severity and incidence) should be quantified for spatiotemporal modeling or for making proper management decisions. This was traditionally done by experts or well-trained local farmers, which is time-consuming, costly and subject to human error. To overcome these limitations, advanced digital vision tools have been developed such as Leaf Doctor and the Estimate application.

Wheat suffers from various diseases including three devastating rusts: stripe (yellow) rust, leaf (brown) rust, and stem (black) rust. Wheat rust likely already occurred at the time of wheat domestication around 12 000 years ago. Archeologists have found 3 300-year-old stem rust-infected wheat lemma fragments from the Late Bronze Age II (1 400 to 1 200 BCE), demonstrating that early human civilization had endured wheat rust. Since the establishment of the science of plant pathology around the mid-1800s, extensive efforts have been made to study wheat rust diseases, including pathogen biology, disease epidemiology, genetics and breeding to select resistant varieties. Several programmes have contributed to the management of wheat rust, such as the green revolution worldwide and the barberry eradication programme in the United States of America and in Europe. Rust fungi, however, can quickly evolve and migrate, with several newly emerged strains threatening global wheat supply. For example, Ug99, a wheat stem rust race that was initially detected in Africa in 1999, affected most commercial wheat cultivars and quickly spread throughout the worlds prime wheat-growing regions. All three wheat rusts have been reported in almost every country with significant wheat production, where their incidence and impact is mediated by local cultivars, environmental conditions, and pathogen virulence. Norman Borlaug, Nobel laureate and father of the green revolution, even summarized the issue with the quote: Rust never sleeps. Hence, in order to prevent devastating rust epidemics, we require long-term efforts on surveillance and monitoring for rust fungi, genetics and resistance breeding, and both applied and fundamental research.

Since the earliest human civilizations, rust diseases have impacted wheat crops, caused devastating epidemics, and compromised food security and human wellbeing. The scientific understanding of rust biology, ecology and epidemiology, as gained over the span of a century, enables sustainable management of wheat rust. Diagnostic platforms and monitoring systems in prime wheat cropping areas are key to detect new virulence, anticipate rust outbreaks, and guide resistance breeding. To prevent rust epidemics, a coordinated implementation of agroecological measures, such as crop rotation, removal of volunteer wheat, or alternative host plants at field and landscape scales is essential. Varietal resistance, including multilines and varietal mixtures, can constitute a user-friendly, cost-effective and environmentally sound way to manage wheat rust. Resistant varieties are not a silver bullet, but need to be consciously paired with systems-level interventions and diversification tactics.

CIMMYTs breeding programme has successfully utilized this strategy to develop resistant wheat varieties that are currently grown by millions of smallholder farmers worldwide. Another way is to develop and use multiline cultivars that are isogenic but differ in the resistance genes in each cultivar. While diversifying resistance genes could decrease the selection pression from hosts exerted to plant pathogens, multiline cultivars need to ensure uniformity in maturity and grain quality. Multilines and varietal mixtures are currently not used to control wheat rusts even though the strategy has been known for more than 50 years. To guide resistance breeding efforts, a wheat resistance gene atlas has been developed consisting of an online directory that reports sources of resistance. While the ultimate goal of this atlas is to turn wheat into a nonhost for its major pathogens, its practicality needs to be determined. Chemical control. Chemical control assumes a minor role in stem rust management for the following three reasons: (i) high effectiveness of host resistance, (ii) remarkably rapid disease proliferation under optimum environmental conditions, and (iii) relatively low economic value of wheat as compared to the cost of fungicide applications. Notwithstanding the above, chemical control sometimes constitutes the only option to reduce yield losses during rust epidemics provided their application is made at the onset of the epidemic. A wide range of fungicide active ingredients or formulations are available for the management of stripe rust. For wheat leaf rust, some older generations of fungicides prove effective and are often applied as seed dressings, although the latter increase the odds of resistance development, exacerbate environmental pollution and negatively impact soil biota. For these reasons, fungicidal seed treatment does not pose a sustainable solution and its usage is not endorsed. As rust fungi rapidly develop fungicide resistance, different active ingredients should be rotated and more importantly, non-chemical preventative strategies need to be deliberately prioritized. Cultural control. To prevent rust disease problems, cultural control is to become a frontline management approach. Indeed, several cultural methods reduce the intensity of wheat rust epidemics. First, rust epidemics can be effectively reduced by changing the overall cropping system. This can include rotation with non-host crops, or growing only winter or spring wheat, if possible. This reduces the amount of infection inoculum, especially for regions where inoculum is endogenous. Second, break the "green bridges" that carry inoculum from one crop to the next. These green bridges generally consist of volunteer plants, crops that are year-after-year cultivated in the same area, or wild accessory hosts. Removal or avoidance of green bridges can prove highly effective, especially where the inoculum is endogenous. In this regard, it is important to gain sufficient in-depth knowledge of the formae speciales of endemic rusts, their host ranges, and movement of inoculum e.g. between cereals and nearby forage crops. Third, appropriate timing of planting could delay or even avoid the wheat rust onset. For all three rusts, appropriate late planting in the autumn under conditions that do not reduce yield potential can shorten the time of crop exposure to the rust pathogens. Yet, the effects of planting time for spring wheat differ between the three rusts and depend on local environmental conditions. For stripe rust, late planting in spring may shorten the period of time during which crops are vulnerable to disease. However, this would increase the chance of stem and leaf rust epidemics, since weather and environment in late season are generally favourable for these rusts. Fourth, eradication of the alternate hosts can be highly effective by preventing sexual Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases 16

stages of the rust fungi. All three wheat rust fungi have proven to be heteroecious, with asexual stages on wheat and sexual stages on alternate hosts. Programmes to eradicate alternate hosts such as Berberis sp. have been instrumental in limiting stem rust epidemics in North America and in Europe. Barberry eradication affects stem rust epidemics through four modalities: (i) delayed disease onset, (ii) reduced initial inoculum level, (iii) fewer pathogen races, and (iv) more stabled pathogen phenotypes. However, its effectiveness is limited for other wheat rusts, such as stripe rust. Some other cultural control approaches include planting cultivar mixtures or a mixture of crops, avoiding excessive irrigation and defining fertilization schemes in line with the needs of the crop. Biological control. The effectiveness of biological control of wheat rusts is limited, and therefore not commonly used in fields. One parasitic fungus that can infect multiple rust fungi is Darluca filum . Also, some Alternaria alternata strains, Aphanocladium album , Verticillium niveostratosum , V. fungicola , and Cephalosporium acremonium can hyperparasitize wheat stripe rust fungi. However, the biological control potential of many of the above microorganisms is limited because of the rapid dispersion of rusts and the comparatively slow in-field population build-up of these antagonistic fungi. Yin-yang concept. To comprehensively understand the integrated management of wheat rusts, we propose a yin-yang concept incorporating all above strategies (see Figure 2.3 on p. 18). This model presents the co-existence and co-evolution of pathogen population (coloured orange) and host population (coloured green). The first layer of management involves cultural practices and environmental conditions which provide an isolation between host and pathogen. In this layer, management strategies include, but are not limited to, cultural control. The second layer of management is to apply wheat resistance after the exclusion of disease is impossible. One needs to account for the emergence or re-emergence of virulence in the host population with high resistance (the solid orange circle surrounded by green in Figure 2.3 on p. 18), as this newly emerged virulence could become prevalent and eventually break down host resistance (the solid green circle surrounded by orange). The final layer of management involves chemical and biological control to minimize the virulent pathogen population and protect the susceptible host population. 17 2. WHEAT RUST

Dr. Xianming Chen, USDA-ARS Research Plant Pathologist, released his first stripe rust forecast of 2025. Using a set of forecast models based on weather data from November and December 2024, he is predicting that stripe rust in the 2025 wheat growing season may be severe with anywhere from 0 to 29% yield loss in commercially grown varieties. The relatively warm weather in November and December has been conducive to the survival of the rust fungus in wheat so far. Please note that this forecast [...] favorable for stripe rust, its impact remains uncertain. Dr. Chen’s March predictions are generally more reliable due to improved knowledge of winter conditions and potential visual surveys for stripe rust presence. [...] Based on this forecast, fields planted to winter wheat varieties with moderate (M, rating 5) to moderately susceptible (MS, ratings 6 and 7) or susceptible (S, ratings 8 and 9) may need an early fungicide application at the time of herbicide application. Growers planning to plant spring wheat this year should consider only planting resistant (R, ratings 1 and 2) or moderately resistant (MR, ratings 3 and 4) varieties this spring. While the current long-range forecast predicts mild temperatures,

Publications [...] Yield Losses and Impact
-----------------------

When conditions are favorable, yield losses can exceed 70 percent. Yield losses are often related to the timing of disease onset and varietal susceptibility —infections that occur earlier in the season result in greater yield loss. Yields may still be reduced when leaf infection occurs after heading (as long as conditions are conducive for disease).

Always read and follow pesticide label directions, insect resistance management requirements (where applicable), and grain marketing and all other stewardship practices.

though the diseases can occur at significant levels in particular fields or throughout a particular growing region. The persistence of rust as a significant disease in wheat can be attributed to specific characteristics of the rust fungi. These characteristics include a capacity to produce a large number of spores—which can be wind-disseminated over long distances and infect wheat under favorable environmental conditions—and the ability to change genetically, thereby producing new races with [...] Rust diseases of wheat are among the oldest plant diseases known to humans. Early literature on wheat cultivation mentions these devastating diseases and their ability to destroy entire wheat crops. Since rust discovery, numerous studies have been conducted on the life cycles of rust pathogens and their management. The information gained from these studies has enabled us to develop best management practices that reduce the impact of the diseases. Today, worldwide epidemic losses are rare, [...] These causal agents exist in many different physiologic races that vary in their aggressiveness and pathogenicity on various host plants. Plant breeders have been able to develop genetic resistance (or tolerance) within wheat cultivars to a variety of races of the rusts. The resistant cultivars have been highly effective such that many rust races prevalent in the past are now nearly nonexistent. However, sexual recombination and mutation in the pathogens allow for development of new races.

MLND-associated viruses in the Potyviridae family are ubiquitous worldwide, and different species predominate in different geographical regions. SCMV is found worldwide, and MDMV is distributed widely in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, WSMV, JGMV, and sorghum mosaic virus cause diseases on maize with limited distribution. In the United States, MDMV is common and SCMV is also present. In Africa, JGMV and MDMV are present, and SCMV is predominant. In the 1920s and 1930s, SCMV was described in southern and eastern Africa. In a survey during the 1980s, SCMV was observed in some areas of the United Republic of Tanzania and Kenya. However, the recent detection of SCMV in Kenyas coastal regions and Nairobi hint at a continued spread of the disease in eastern Africa. As SCMV and MDMV are widely distributed, the geographical distribution of MCMV is crucial for the occurrence of MLND. MCMV was first identified in Peru in 1971, and MLND outbreaks were subsequently recorded in the states of Hawaii, Kansas and Nebraska in the United States. In recent years, the disease has been identified in Asia and Africa. In 2009, MCMV was detected in Yunnan province of China, inducing MLND through co-infection with SCMV. In 2011, the first outbreak of MLND in Africa was reported in east Africa along the Rift Valley regions of Kenya and the disease subsequently spread quickly. Now, MLND has been identified in several African countries, from Ethiopia in the north, to the United Republic of Tanzania in the south; and Kenya in the east to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At present, MLND has been reported in more than 15 countries.

Detection and inspection Monitoring. Yellow sticky traps are a useful tool for monitoring B. tabaci . For example, 75 yellow sticky cards (24 cm x 20 cm) can be placed at canopy height in one hectare of crop field, at equal distances. Using this monitoring method, numerical thresholds can be defined for different management tactics: (i) at 0.250.5 adults/cm , 2 biological control measures, such as the release of natural enemies, should be taken; (ii) at 34 adult/cm , chemical control measures or biopesticide spray applications 2 are recommended to prevent whitefly outbreaks. Sampling via the leaf-turn method is also commonly used for whitefly monitoring and decision-making. Because the within-plant distribution pattern of whiteflies varies with plant phenology, and whitefly or plant species, sampling protocols must take these and, potentially, other factors into account. Accordingly, the exact whitefly infestation levels at which management intervention is warranted can vary widely. Economic thresholds and action thresholds are prime decision criteria for farmers and pest management professionals, applicable to all pests, crops and farming contexts. In general, thresholds are experimentally defined as the pest infestation level at which curative control measures should be deployed (while accounting for a time lag to yield impact) to avoid significant crop damage. Economic thresholds are based upon an economic injury level (EIL) and thus, involve rigorous economic criteria, for example, tabulated input expenditure, labour costs, and value of the harvested produce. Under specific market and environmental conditions in China, an EIL was established for whitefly on cucumber plant at 18 adults per plant at the four-leaf stage and, on greenhouse tomato, at 13.6 adults per 100 leaves. On cabbage, thresholds have been set at 6.0 to 6.8 adults per plant in the seedling stage and at 2.1 to 3.8 adults per plant in the rosette stage. More pragmatic thresholds with a far weaker economic foundation have been defined in some Chinese vegetable crops. These experimental action thresholds specify that natural enemy releases should be done once adult whiteflies reach densities of 0.5 to 2 adults/leaf, while higher densities (i.e. five to six adults/leaf) warrant the use of environmentally friendly insecticides or biopesticides. This has been taken a step further in European greenhouse systems, where simulation models are used to define the release size and timing of predators and parasitoids in order to keep whitefly numbers below EIL. Thresholds have also been defined that concurrently account for the actual population densities of whitefly and a 72 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

Integrated nutrient management : Combined application of azotobacter (seed treatment@500g/ ha) + 75% recommended N and 100% P&K (125:60:60) is an optimum nutrient combination for obtaining higher fruit yield.

Species from the B. tabaci whitefly complex can be found worldwide, though most of them have a limited distribution in one continent. A few species, such as MEAM1 and MED, show a global distribution recorded in more than 70 countries and 40 countries, respectively, apparently via human-aided spread and invasion in recent decades. With the expansion of greenhouse production in many countries, these species are still expanding their distribution, particularly to the cool temperate regions where they did not occur before. New incursions of new whitefly species, especially the invasive MEAM1 and MED, is often caused by movement of infested plant materials. Plant movement thus facilitates the spread of insecticide resistance genes, leading to increases in the use of chemicals and, in turn, adverse impacts on the environment.

Line sowing is done at a spacing of 30 10 cm. The crop is grown under rainfed conditions with no intercrop. Hand weeding is the primary weed control method. Blast disease is managed by spraying Saaf at 2 g per litre of water. Stem borer is controlled using Coragen at 0.5 g per litre of water.

ensuing honeydew production, thus exacerbating crop damage and yield or quality loss. Higher populations of B. tabaci are regularly observed on water-stressed, versus well-watered, cotton plants. In the meantime, B. tabaci that feed on well-watered plants produce more honeydew with higher sugar contents than on drought-stressed cotton, which can aggravate sooty mould issues. Host-plant resistance. The establishment of crop varieties that are resistant to B. tabaci and associated viruses such as tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV, is a preferred solution to minimize whitefly-related damage. The Mi-1 gene, present in many varieties of cultivated tomato and introduced into this plant from its wild relative, S. peruvianum , regulates resistance to B. tabaci , the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae and root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. Physical control. In greenhouse or tunnel systems, nylon screen netting (mesh diameter 0.125 mm) can effectively reduce whitefly infestation levels and yellow sticky cards are routinely used for monitoring purposes though these can also help to lower population levels. Yellow sticky card (24 cm x 20 cm) trap adult whiteflies efficiently when placed vertically among plants at or slightly above canopy level with one card per 3 m to 5 m. Under field conditions, reflective mulches repel whiteflies, oil-coated yellow mulches act as a trap for whiteflies, floating row covers can physically exclude whiteflies during specific stages of the host crop, while a variety of crop and non-crop plants can be established as barrier or (dead-end) trap crops. In addition to the yellow wavelengths that are attractive to whitefly adults, filtration of ultraviolet (UV) light in the range of 280 nm to 380 nm can slow whitefly proliferation. Eliminating the UV portion of the light spectrum interferes with the UV vision of insects and dramatically affects their orientation behavior in the crop. In protected vegetable crops, UV-absorbing polyethylene films, mesh nets or mulches filter most of the UV portion of the light spectrum and significantly reduces infestation pressure of whitefly, aphids, thrips and leafminers. These relatively simple, low-cost approaches can be key in avoiding whitefly-related issues. Biological control. A diverse set of arthropod natural enemies have been recorded and studied in a wide range of cropping systems and geographies, and predation or parasitism consistently feature as the main mortality factors for B. tabaci in cultivated crops. More than 150 arthropod species belonging to nine orders and 31 families prey upon B. tabaci whitefly, most of which are beetles (Coccinellidae), true bugs (Miridae, Anthocoridae), lacewings (Chrysopidae), mites (Phytoseiidae) and spiders (Araneae). Predatory mirids are extensively used in the Mediterranean basin, where Macrolophus caliginosus and Nesidiocoris tenuis are highly abundant in crops where little or no broad-spectrum insecticides are used. In those settings, these predators provide efficient control of whitefly populations and a suite of secondary pests. The release of N. tenuis , at a rate of either 0.1 or four individuals/ plant, can reduce B. tabaci populations by over 90 percent. Some predators however do exhibit zoophytophagous feeding habits and sporadically cause flower abortion and yield losses. The combined release of predators and parasitoids often improves whitefly control, as evidenced by the combined use of M. caliginosus and Eretmocerus mundus in greenhouse tomato greenhouses or simultaneous releases of predaceous mite Amblyseius swirskii and Er. mundus in sweet potato greenhouses and in open field eggplant. 74 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

 Streptocycline (0.1 g), copper sulfate (0.1 g), and biofertilizer Azospirillum at 400 g per 25 kg seed mixed with 50 g of jaggery. Seedlings may also undergo root dipping in Carbendazim solution before transplanting. Transplanting is done either manually or with machines, maintaining a spacing of 20 by 10 cm or 8 by 4 inches depending on the practice. Weed management begins with pre-emergent application of Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1 L/acre or Pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10% WP at 200 g per hectare, followed by post-emergent spraying of Bispyribac sodium 10 SC at 100 ml per acre. Paddy crops can be rainfed, especially for varieties like MO-4 and Tunga, while others require irrigation during critical stages such as tillering, panicle initiation, lowering, and grain illing. Additional foliar nutrient application includes potassium nitrate at 10 grams per litre of water at 60 days after transplanting, along with nano urea, nano DAP, and micronutrient sprays such as Samriddhi. Zinc sulphate may also be sprayed at 10 g per litre. Pest management involves several strategies. For stem borer control, clipping the terminal leaf during transplanting is recommended, along with spraying Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 2 ml per litre or applying Fipronil 0.3G at 10 kg per acre and using pheromone traps at the rate of 7 per acre. Leaf folder can be managed with Flubendiamide 48 SC at 0.08 ml per litre, while gall midge is controlled with Chlorpyriphos sprays. For brown plant hopper and case worm, soil application of Carbofuran granules (10% at 5 kg or 3G at 8 kg per acre) is effective. In terms of disease management, blast is addressed through seed treatment with Carbendazim and spraying Tricyclazole 75 WP at 0.6 to 1 g per litre or Propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml per litre. Brown leaf spot is managed by spraying Carbendazim at 1 g per litre. Bacterial blight is controlled using a combination of copper oxychloride (50 g) and Streptocycline (25 g) per acre.

Research on _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in crop production has shown its importance in improving plant nutrition and amelioration of soil fertility (Kurrey et al., 2018). The scope of utilizing _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in research experiments as microbial inoculant through release of growth substances and their impact on the plant has markedly improved crop production in agriculture (Gothandapani et al., 2017). Bacterial genus _Azotobacter_ is reported to synthesize auxins, cytokinins, and GA-like substances that have been found to be directly associated with improved plant growth (Wani et al., 2013). Owing to its ability to improve plant health through nitrogen fixation, growth hormone production, phosphate solubilization, plant disease management and reclamation of better soil health, _Azotobacter_ is one of the best options to be used as biofertilizer for eco-friendly and sustainable crop production.

In this review, the importance of _Azotobacter_ species was highlighted as both important free-living N 2-fixing bacteria and potential bacterial biofertilizer with proven efficacy for plant nutrition and biological soil fertility. Recently, advancing applied research on _Azotobacter_ species is of special interest as both agriculturally important plant growth promoting N 2-Fixing rhizobacterium (PGPR) that can be used for improving plant N nutrition and a biofertilizer based products at large scale, having significant improvements in crop productivity and soil fertility.

_Azotobacter chroococcum_ is the dominant inhabitant of the arable soils among several species of _Azotobacter,_ which have ability to fix about 2–18 mg N/g of the C-substrate used in culture media (Moraditochaee et al., 2014). Different _Azotobacter_ strains have been isolated from neutral to alkaline soil and usually found in the rhizosphere of various non-legume crops including cotton, wheat, rice and vegetables (Sindhu and Lakshminaryana, 1982; Jain et al., 2021). (2013) reported that inoculation with salinity tolerant _Azotobacter_ strains caused significant increase in total nitrogen, biomass and grain yield of wheat variety WH157 in earthen pots containing saline soil under pot house conditions. Different species of _Azotobacter_ fix 20–40 Kg/ha/year of nitrogen and inoculation of selected strains enhanced germination and vigour of young plants along with grain yield in wheat (Kader et al., 2002).

In associative N fixation, diazotrophs living on the surfaces or in the interstitial spaces of their plant host use photosynthetic products from the plant as carbon sources to fix N for their own use, providing the excess to the host; these microorganisms include Azospirillum brasilense and Pseudomonas_stutzeri_ (Pankievicz et al., 2019; Soumare et al., 2020). Chemical N fertilizer, plant genotype, and other environmental conditions affect the diversity of the _nifH_ gene pool in rice roots (Tan et al., 2003).

Since its discovery in 1901, Azotobacter has been seen as an important agricultural input due to its multiple beneficial effects on plant growth. In earlier studies, the species of Azotobacter have been reported from rhizosphere of several crop plants such as maize, sugarcane, rice, wheat, bajra, millets, plantation crops and vegetables [7]. has to potential to fix atmospheric nitrogen, siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, hydrolytic enzymes, and synthesize growth regulator indole compound and it can used as bio-inoculant for the sustainable and profitable agriculture [83, 84]. takes more time for nodule formation and then only symbiotic nitrogen fixation starts but Azotobacter starts nitrogen fixation asymbiotically in the soil as soon as it establishes there, and thus help better plant growth right from the initial stage of seedling growth.

MLND-associated viruses in the Potyviridae family are ubiquitous worldwide, and different species predominate in different geographical regions. SCMV is found worldwide, and MDMV is distributed widely in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, WSMV, JGMV, and sorghum mosaic virus cause diseases on maize with limited distribution. In the United States, MDMV is common and SCMV is also present. In Africa, JGMV and MDMV are present, and SCMV is predominant. In the 1920s and 1930s, SCMV was described in southern and eastern Africa. In a survey during the 1980s, SCMV was observed in some areas of the United Republic of Tanzania and Kenya. However, the recent detection of SCMV in Kenyas coastal regions and Nairobi hint at a continued spread of the disease in eastern Africa. As SCMV and MDMV are widely distributed, the geographical distribution of MCMV is crucial for the occurrence of MLND. MCMV was first identified in Peru in 1971, and MLND outbreaks were subsequently recorded in the states of Hawaii, Kansas and Nebraska in the United States. In recent years, the disease has been identified in Asia and Africa. In 2009, MCMV was detected in Yunnan province of China, inducing MLND through co-infection with SCMV. In 2011, the first outbreak of MLND in Africa was reported in east Africa along the Rift Valley regions of Kenya and the disease subsequently spread quickly. Now, MLND has been identified in several African countries, from Ethiopia in the north, to the United Republic of Tanzania in the south; and Kenya in the east to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At present, MLND has been reported in more than 15 countries.

CIMMYTs breeding programme has successfully utilized this strategy to develop resistant wheat varieties that are currently grown by millions of smallholder farmers worldwide. Another way is to develop and use multiline cultivars that are isogenic but differ in the resistance genes in each cultivar. While diversifying resistance genes could decrease the selection pression from hosts exerted to plant pathogens, multiline cultivars need to ensure uniformity in maturity and grain quality. Multilines and varietal mixtures are currently not used to control wheat rusts even though the strategy has been known for more than 50 years. To guide resistance breeding efforts, a wheat resistance gene atlas has been developed consisting of an online directory that reports sources of resistance. While the ultimate goal of this atlas is to turn wheat into a nonhost for its major pathogens, its practicality needs to be determined. Chemical control. Chemical control assumes a minor role in stem rust management for the following three reasons: (i) high effectiveness of host resistance, (ii) remarkably rapid disease proliferation under optimum environmental conditions, and (iii) relatively low economic value of wheat as compared to the cost of fungicide applications. Notwithstanding the above, chemical control sometimes constitutes the only option to reduce yield losses during rust epidemics provided their application is made at the onset of the epidemic. A wide range of fungicide active ingredients or formulations are available for the management of stripe rust. For wheat leaf rust, some older generations of fungicides prove effective and are often applied as seed dressings, although the latter increase the odds of resistance development, exacerbate environmental pollution and negatively impact soil biota. For these reasons, fungicidal seed treatment does not pose a sustainable solution and its usage is not endorsed. As rust fungi rapidly develop fungicide resistance, different active ingredients should be rotated and more importantly, non-chemical preventative strategies need to be deliberately prioritized. Cultural control. To prevent rust disease problems, cultural control is to become a frontline management approach. Indeed, several cultural methods reduce the intensity of wheat rust epidemics. First, rust epidemics can be effectively reduced by changing the overall cropping system. This can include rotation with non-host crops, or growing only winter or spring wheat, if possible. This reduces the amount of infection inoculum, especially for regions where inoculum is endogenous. Second, break the "green bridges" that carry inoculum from one crop to the next. These green bridges generally consist of volunteer plants, crops that are year-after-year cultivated in the same area, or wild accessory hosts. Removal or avoidance of green bridges can prove highly effective, especially where the inoculum is endogenous. In this regard, it is important to gain sufficient in-depth knowledge of the formae speciales of endemic rusts, their host ranges, and movement of inoculum e.g. between cereals and nearby forage crops. Third, appropriate timing of planting could delay or even avoid the wheat rust onset. For all three rusts, appropriate late planting in the autumn under conditions that do not reduce yield potential can shorten the time of crop exposure to the rust pathogens. Yet, the effects of planting time for spring wheat differ between the three rusts and depend on local environmental conditions. For stripe rust, late planting in spring may shorten the period of time during which crops are vulnerable to disease. However, this would increase the chance of stem and leaf rust epidemics, since weather and environment in late season are generally favourable for these rusts. Fourth, eradication of the alternate hosts can be highly effective by preventing sexual Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases 16

Detection and inspection Monitoring. Yellow sticky traps are a useful tool for monitoring B. tabaci . For example, 75 yellow sticky cards (24 cm x 20 cm) can be placed at canopy height in one hectare of crop field, at equal distances. Using this monitoring method, numerical thresholds can be defined for different management tactics: (i) at 0.250.5 adults/cm , 2 biological control measures, such as the release of natural enemies, should be taken; (ii) at 34 adult/cm , chemical control measures or biopesticide spray applications 2 are recommended to prevent whitefly outbreaks. Sampling via the leaf-turn method is also commonly used for whitefly monitoring and decision-making. Because the within-plant distribution pattern of whiteflies varies with plant phenology, and whitefly or plant species, sampling protocols must take these and, potentially, other factors into account. Accordingly, the exact whitefly infestation levels at which management intervention is warranted can vary widely. Economic thresholds and action thresholds are prime decision criteria for farmers and pest management professionals, applicable to all pests, crops and farming contexts. In general, thresholds are experimentally defined as the pest infestation level at which curative control measures should be deployed (while accounting for a time lag to yield impact) to avoid significant crop damage. Economic thresholds are based upon an economic injury level (EIL) and thus, involve rigorous economic criteria, for example, tabulated input expenditure, labour costs, and value of the harvested produce. Under specific market and environmental conditions in China, an EIL was established for whitefly on cucumber plant at 18 adults per plant at the four-leaf stage and, on greenhouse tomato, at 13.6 adults per 100 leaves. On cabbage, thresholds have been set at 6.0 to 6.8 adults per plant in the seedling stage and at 2.1 to 3.8 adults per plant in the rosette stage. More pragmatic thresholds with a far weaker economic foundation have been defined in some Chinese vegetable crops. These experimental action thresholds specify that natural enemy releases should be done once adult whiteflies reach densities of 0.5 to 2 adults/leaf, while higher densities (i.e. five to six adults/leaf) warrant the use of environmentally friendly insecticides or biopesticides. This has been taken a step further in European greenhouse systems, where simulation models are used to define the release size and timing of predators and parasitoids in order to keep whitefly numbers below EIL. Thresholds have also been defined that concurrently account for the actual population densities of whitefly and a 72 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

Integrated nutrient management : Combined application of azotobacter (seed treatment@500g/ ha) + 75% recommended N and 100% P&K (125:60:60) is an optimum nutrient combination for obtaining higher fruit yield.

Species from the B. tabaci whitefly complex can be found worldwide, though most of them have a limited distribution in one continent. A few species, such as MEAM1 and MED, show a global distribution recorded in more than 70 countries and 40 countries, respectively, apparently via human-aided spread and invasion in recent decades. With the expansion of greenhouse production in many countries, these species are still expanding their distribution, particularly to the cool temperate regions where they did not occur before. New incursions of new whitefly species, especially the invasive MEAM1 and MED, is often caused by movement of infested plant materials. Plant movement thus facilitates the spread of insecticide resistance genes, leading to increases in the use of chemicals and, in turn, adverse impacts on the environment.

The genus _Azotobacter_ has been used as a biofertilizer more than a century (Gerlach and Vogel, 1902). Using _Azotobacter_ strains as a bioinoculant for a wide range of crops (cereals, tomato, eggplant, carrot, and sugarcane), has been reported to lead to better yield results (Mrkovacki and Milic, 2001). N 2-Fixing biofertilizers like _Rhizobium_, _Azotobacter_, and _Azospirillum_, which are majorly used for BNF in seed and soil treatment applications, currently represent the largest segment [...] The importance of _Azotobacter_ as microbial inoculant is convincingly established throughout various experiments and large number of field trials. Ritika and Utpal (2014) showed in their review that the use of _Azotobacter_ as N-biofertilizer increased the growth and yield of various crops under field conditions with a percentage increase of up to 40% for Cauliflower and 15â€“20% for Maize compared to conventional fertilizers. These beneficial effects can be attributed to the biosynthesis of [...] Recently, advancing applied research on _Azotobacter_ species is of special interest as both agriculturally important plant growth promoting N 2-Fixing rhizobacterium (PGPR) that can be used for improving plant N nutrition and a biofertilizer based products at large scale, having significant improvements in crop productivity and soil fertility. Besides BNF, _Azotobacter_ species are able to influence directly plant growth by synthesizing plant growth hormones [e.g., Indole Acetic Acid (IAA),

MLND-associated viruses in the Potyviridae family are ubiquitous worldwide, and different species predominate in different geographical regions. SCMV is found worldwide, and MDMV is distributed widely in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, WSMV, JGMV, and sorghum mosaic virus cause diseases on maize with limited distribution. In the United States, MDMV is common and SCMV is also present. In Africa, JGMV and MDMV are present, and SCMV is predominant. In the 1920s and 1930s, SCMV was described in southern and eastern Africa. In a survey during the 1980s, SCMV was observed in some areas of the United Republic of Tanzania and Kenya. However, the recent detection of SCMV in Kenyas coastal regions and Nairobi hint at a continued spread of the disease in eastern Africa. As SCMV and MDMV are widely distributed, the geographical distribution of MCMV is crucial for the occurrence of MLND. MCMV was first identified in Peru in 1971, and MLND outbreaks were subsequently recorded in the states of Hawaii, Kansas and Nebraska in the United States. In recent years, the disease has been identified in Asia and Africa. In 2009, MCMV was detected in Yunnan province of China, inducing MLND through co-infection with SCMV. In 2011, the first outbreak of MLND in Africa was reported in east Africa along the Rift Valley regions of Kenya and the disease subsequently spread quickly. Now, MLND has been identified in several African countries, from Ethiopia in the north, to the United Republic of Tanzania in the south; and Kenya in the east to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At present, MLND has been reported in more than 15 countries.

CIMMYTs breeding programme has successfully utilized this strategy to develop resistant wheat varieties that are currently grown by millions of smallholder farmers worldwide. Another way is to develop and use multiline cultivars that are isogenic but differ in the resistance genes in each cultivar. While diversifying resistance genes could decrease the selection pression from hosts exerted to plant pathogens, multiline cultivars need to ensure uniformity in maturity and grain quality. Multilines and varietal mixtures are currently not used to control wheat rusts even though the strategy has been known for more than 50 years. To guide resistance breeding efforts, a wheat resistance gene atlas has been developed consisting of an online directory that reports sources of resistance. While the ultimate goal of this atlas is to turn wheat into a nonhost for its major pathogens, its practicality needs to be determined. Chemical control. Chemical control assumes a minor role in stem rust management for the following three reasons: (i) high effectiveness of host resistance, (ii) remarkably rapid disease proliferation under optimum environmental conditions, and (iii) relatively low economic value of wheat as compared to the cost of fungicide applications. Notwithstanding the above, chemical control sometimes constitutes the only option to reduce yield losses during rust epidemics provided their application is made at the onset of the epidemic. A wide range of fungicide active ingredients or formulations are available for the management of stripe rust. For wheat leaf rust, some older generations of fungicides prove effective and are often applied as seed dressings, although the latter increase the odds of resistance development, exacerbate environmental pollution and negatively impact soil biota. For these reasons, fungicidal seed treatment does not pose a sustainable solution and its usage is not endorsed. As rust fungi rapidly develop fungicide resistance, different active ingredients should be rotated and more importantly, non-chemical preventative strategies need to be deliberately prioritized. Cultural control. To prevent rust disease problems, cultural control is to become a frontline management approach. Indeed, several cultural methods reduce the intensity of wheat rust epidemics. First, rust epidemics can be effectively reduced by changing the overall cropping system. This can include rotation with non-host crops, or growing only winter or spring wheat, if possible. This reduces the amount of infection inoculum, especially for regions where inoculum is endogenous. Second, break the "green bridges" that carry inoculum from one crop to the next. These green bridges generally consist of volunteer plants, crops that are year-after-year cultivated in the same area, or wild accessory hosts. Removal or avoidance of green bridges can prove highly effective, especially where the inoculum is endogenous. In this regard, it is important to gain sufficient in-depth knowledge of the formae speciales of endemic rusts, their host ranges, and movement of inoculum e.g. between cereals and nearby forage crops. Third, appropriate timing of planting could delay or even avoid the wheat rust onset. For all three rusts, appropriate late planting in the autumn under conditions that do not reduce yield potential can shorten the time of crop exposure to the rust pathogens. Yet, the effects of planting time for spring wheat differ between the three rusts and depend on local environmental conditions. For stripe rust, late planting in spring may shorten the period of time during which crops are vulnerable to disease. However, this would increase the chance of stem and leaf rust epidemics, since weather and environment in late season are generally favourable for these rusts. Fourth, eradication of the alternate hosts can be highly effective by preventing sexual Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases 16

Detection and inspection Monitoring. Yellow sticky traps are a useful tool for monitoring B. tabaci . For example, 75 yellow sticky cards (24 cm x 20 cm) can be placed at canopy height in one hectare of crop field, at equal distances. Using this monitoring method, numerical thresholds can be defined for different management tactics: (i) at 0.250.5 adults/cm , 2 biological control measures, such as the release of natural enemies, should be taken; (ii) at 34 adult/cm , chemical control measures or biopesticide spray applications 2 are recommended to prevent whitefly outbreaks. Sampling via the leaf-turn method is also commonly used for whitefly monitoring and decision-making. Because the within-plant distribution pattern of whiteflies varies with plant phenology, and whitefly or plant species, sampling protocols must take these and, potentially, other factors into account. Accordingly, the exact whitefly infestation levels at which management intervention is warranted can vary widely. Economic thresholds and action thresholds are prime decision criteria for farmers and pest management professionals, applicable to all pests, crops and farming contexts. In general, thresholds are experimentally defined as the pest infestation level at which curative control measures should be deployed (while accounting for a time lag to yield impact) to avoid significant crop damage. Economic thresholds are based upon an economic injury level (EIL) and thus, involve rigorous economic criteria, for example, tabulated input expenditure, labour costs, and value of the harvested produce. Under specific market and environmental conditions in China, an EIL was established for whitefly on cucumber plant at 18 adults per plant at the four-leaf stage and, on greenhouse tomato, at 13.6 adults per 100 leaves. On cabbage, thresholds have been set at 6.0 to 6.8 adults per plant in the seedling stage and at 2.1 to 3.8 adults per plant in the rosette stage. More pragmatic thresholds with a far weaker economic foundation have been defined in some Chinese vegetable crops. These experimental action thresholds specify that natural enemy releases should be done once adult whiteflies reach densities of 0.5 to 2 adults/leaf, while higher densities (i.e. five to six adults/leaf) warrant the use of environmentally friendly insecticides or biopesticides. This has been taken a step further in European greenhouse systems, where simulation models are used to define the release size and timing of predators and parasitoids in order to keep whitefly numbers below EIL. Thresholds have also been defined that concurrently account for the actual population densities of whitefly and a 72 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

Integrated nutrient management : Combined application of azotobacter (seed treatment@500g/ ha) + 75% recommended N and 100% P&K (125:60:60) is an optimum nutrient combination for obtaining higher fruit yield.

Species from the B. tabaci whitefly complex can be found worldwide, though most of them have a limited distribution in one continent. A few species, such as MEAM1 and MED, show a global distribution recorded in more than 70 countries and 40 countries, respectively, apparently via human-aided spread and invasion in recent decades. With the expansion of greenhouse production in many countries, these species are still expanding their distribution, particularly to the cool temperate regions where they did not occur before. New incursions of new whitefly species, especially the invasive MEAM1 and MED, is often caused by movement of infested plant materials. Plant movement thus facilitates the spread of insecticide resistance genes, leading to increases in the use of chemicals and, in turn, adverse impacts on the environment.

Recommended variety is MR-6, with a seed rate of 12.5 kg/ha, sown during June-July. Fertilizer application is 100:50:50 kg NPK/ha. Azospirillum biofertilizer is applied. Line sowing is done at a spacing of 30 10 cm. The crop is grown under rainfed conditions with no intercrop. Hand weeding is the primary weed control method. Blast disease is managed by spraying Saaf at 2 g per litre of water. Stem borer is controlled using Coragen at 0.5 g per litre of water.

ensuing honeydew production, thus exacerbating crop damage and yield or quality loss. Higher populations of B. tabaci are regularly observed on water-stressed, versus well-watered, cotton plants. In the meantime, B. tabaci that feed on well-watered plants produce more honeydew with higher sugar contents than on drought-stressed cotton, which can aggravate sooty mould issues. Host-plant resistance. The establishment of crop varieties that are resistant to B. tabaci and associated viruses such as tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV, is a preferred solution to minimize whitefly-related damage. The Mi-1 gene, present in many varieties of cultivated tomato and introduced into this plant from its wild relative, S. peruvianum , regulates resistance to B. tabaci , the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae and root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. Physical control. In greenhouse or tunnel systems, nylon screen netting (mesh diameter 0.125 mm) can effectively reduce whitefly infestation levels and yellow sticky cards are routinely used for monitoring purposes though these can also help to lower population levels. Yellow sticky card (24 cm x 20 cm) trap adult whiteflies efficiently when placed vertically among plants at or slightly above canopy level with one card per 3 m to 5 m. Under field conditions, reflective mulches repel whiteflies, oil-coated yellow mulches act as a trap for whiteflies, floating row covers can physically exclude whiteflies during specific stages of the host crop, while a variety of crop and non-crop plants can be established as barrier or (dead-end) trap crops. In addition to the yellow wavelengths that are attractive to whitefly adults, filtration of ultraviolet (UV) light in the range of 280 nm to 380 nm can slow whitefly proliferation. Eliminating the UV portion of the light spectrum interferes with the UV vision of insects and dramatically affects their orientation behavior in the crop. In protected vegetable crops, UV-absorbing polyethylene films, mesh nets or mulches filter most of the UV portion of the light spectrum and significantly reduces infestation pressure of whitefly, aphids, thrips and leafminers. These relatively simple, low-cost approaches can be key in avoiding whitefly-related issues. Biological control. A diverse set of arthropod natural enemies have been recorded and studied in a wide range of cropping systems and geographies, and predation or parasitism consistently feature as the main mortality factors for B. tabaci in cultivated crops. More than 150 arthropod species belonging to nine orders and 31 families prey upon B. tabaci whitefly, most of which are beetles (Coccinellidae), true bugs (Miridae, Anthocoridae), lacewings (Chrysopidae), mites (Phytoseiidae) and spiders (Araneae). Predatory mirids are extensively used in the Mediterranean basin, where Macrolophus caliginosus and Nesidiocoris tenuis are highly abundant in crops where little or no broad-spectrum insecticides are used. In those settings, these predators provide efficient control of whitefly populations and a suite of secondary pests. The release of N. tenuis , at a rate of either 0.1 or four individuals/ plant, can reduce B. tabaci populations by over 90 percent. Some predators however do exhibit zoophytophagous feeding habits and sporadically cause flower abortion and yield losses. The combined release of predators and parasitoids often improves whitefly control, as evidenced by the combined use of M. caliginosus and Eretmocerus mundus in greenhouse tomato greenhouses or simultaneous releases of predaceous mite Amblyseius swirskii and Er. mundus in sweet potato greenhouses and in open field eggplant. 74 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

 Streptocycline (0.1 g), copper sulfate (0.1 g), and biofertilizer Azospirillum at 400 g per 25 kg seed mixed with 50 g of jaggery. Seedlings may also undergo root dipping in Carbendazim solution before transplanting. Transplanting is done either manually or with machines, maintaining a spacing of 20 by 10 cm or 8 by 4 inches depending on the practice. Weed management begins with pre-emergent application of Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1 L/acre or Pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10% WP at 200 g per hectare, followed by post-emergent spraying of Bispyribac sodium 10 SC at 100 ml per acre. Paddy crops can be rainfed, especially for varieties like MO-4 and Tunga, while others require irrigation during critical stages such as tillering, panicle initiation, lowering, and grain illing. Additional foliar nutrient application includes potassium nitrate at 10 grams per litre of water at 60 days after transplanting, along with nano urea, nano DAP, and micronutrient sprays such as Samriddhi. Zinc sulphate may also be sprayed at 10 g per litre. Pest management involves several strategies. For stem borer control, clipping the terminal leaf during transplanting is recommended, along with spraying Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 2 ml per litre or applying Fipronil 0.3G at 10 kg per acre and using pheromone traps at the rate of 7 per acre. Leaf folder can be managed with Flubendiamide 48 SC at 0.08 ml per litre, while gall midge is controlled with Chlorpyriphos sprays. For brown plant hopper and case worm, soil application of Carbofuran granules (10% at 5 kg or 3G at 8 kg per acre) is effective. In terms of disease management, blast is addressed through seed treatment with Carbendazim and spraying Tricyclazole 75 WP at 0.6 to 1 g per litre or Propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml per litre. Brown leaf spot is managed by spraying Carbendazim at 1 g per litre. Bacterial blight is controlled using a combination of copper oxychloride (50 g) and Streptocycline (25 g) per acre.

Query: What is Azotobacter used in? for what crops and where are those crops grown?

CIMMYTs breeding programme has successfully utilized this strategy to develop resistant wheat varieties that are currently grown by millions of smallholder farmers worldwide. Another way is to develop and use multiline cultivars that are isogenic but differ in the resistance genes in each cultivar. While diversifying resistance genes could decrease the selection pression from hosts exerted to plant pathogens, multiline cultivars need to ensure uniformity in maturity and grain quality. Multilines and varietal mixtures are currently not used to control wheat rusts even though the strategy has been known for more than 50 years. To guide resistance breeding efforts, a wheat resistance gene atlas has been developed consisting of an online directory that reports sources of resistance. While the ultimate goal of this atlas is to turn wheat into a nonhost for its major pathogens, its practicality needs to be determined. Chemical control. Chemical control assumes a minor role in stem rust management for the following three reasons: (i) high effectiveness of host resistance, (ii) remarkably rapid disease proliferation under optimum environmental conditions, and (iii) relatively low economic value of wheat as compared to the cost of fungicide applications. Notwithstanding the above, chemical control sometimes constitutes the only option to reduce yield losses during rust epidemics provided their application is made at the onset of the epidemic. A wide range of fungicide active ingredients or formulations are available for the management of stripe rust. For wheat leaf rust, some older generations of fungicides prove effective and are often applied as seed dressings, although the latter increase the odds of resistance development, exacerbate environmental pollution and negatively impact soil biota. For these reasons, fungicidal seed treatment does not pose a sustainable solution and its usage is not endorsed. As rust fungi rapidly develop fungicide resistance, different active ingredients should be rotated and more importantly, non-chemical preventative strategies need to be deliberately prioritized. Cultural control. To prevent rust disease problems, cultural control is to become a frontline management approach. Indeed, several cultural methods reduce the intensity of wheat rust epidemics. First, rust epidemics can be effectively reduced by changing the overall cropping system. This can include rotation with non-host crops, or growing only winter or spring wheat, if possible. This reduces the amount of infection inoculum, especially for regions where inoculum is endogenous. Second, break the "green bridges" that carry inoculum from one crop to the next. These green bridges generally consist of volunteer plants, crops that are year-after-year cultivated in the same area, or wild accessory hosts. Removal or avoidance of green bridges can prove highly effective, especially where the inoculum is endogenous. In this regard, it is important to gain sufficient in-depth knowledge of the formae speciales of endemic rusts, their host ranges, and movement of inoculum e.g. between cereals and nearby forage crops. Third, appropriate timing of planting could delay or even avoid the wheat rust onset. For all three rusts, appropriate late planting in the autumn under conditions that do not reduce yield potential can shorten the time of crop exposure to the rust pathogens. Yet, the effects of planting time for spring wheat differ between the three rusts and depend on local environmental conditions. For stripe rust, late planting in spring may shorten the period of time during which crops are vulnerable to disease. However, this would increase the chance of stem and leaf rust epidemics, since weather and environment in late season are generally favourable for these rusts. Fourth, eradication of the alternate hosts can be highly effective by preventing sexual Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases 16

MLND-associated viruses in the Potyviridae family are ubiquitous worldwide, and different species predominate in different geographical regions. SCMV is found worldwide, and MDMV is distributed widely in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, WSMV, JGMV, and sorghum mosaic virus cause diseases on maize with limited distribution. In the United States, MDMV is common and SCMV is also present. In Africa, JGMV and MDMV are present, and SCMV is predominant. In the 1920s and 1930s, SCMV was described in southern and eastern Africa. In a survey during the 1980s, SCMV was observed in some areas of the United Republic of Tanzania and Kenya. However, the recent detection of SCMV in Kenyas coastal regions and Nairobi hint at a continued spread of the disease in eastern Africa. As SCMV and MDMV are widely distributed, the geographical distribution of MCMV is crucial for the occurrence of MLND. MCMV was first identified in Peru in 1971, and MLND outbreaks were subsequently recorded in the states of Hawaii, Kansas and Nebraska in the United States. In recent years, the disease has been identified in Asia and Africa. In 2009, MCMV was detected in Yunnan province of China, inducing MLND through co-infection with SCMV. In 2011, the first outbreak of MLND in Africa was reported in east Africa along the Rift Valley regions of Kenya and the disease subsequently spread quickly. Now, MLND has been identified in several African countries, from Ethiopia in the north, to the United Republic of Tanzania in the south; and Kenya in the east to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At present, MLND has been reported in more than 15 countries.

Species from the B. tabaci whitefly complex can be found worldwide, though most of them have a limited distribution in one continent. A few species, such as MEAM1 and MED, show a global distribution recorded in more than 70 countries and 40 countries, respectively, apparently via human-aided spread and invasion in recent decades. With the expansion of greenhouse production in many countries, these species are still expanding their distribution, particularly to the cool temperate regions where they did not occur before. New incursions of new whitefly species, especially the invasive MEAM1 and MED, is often caused by movement of infested plant materials. Plant movement thus facilitates the spread of insecticide resistance genes, leading to increases in the use of chemicals and, in turn, adverse impacts on the environment.

Integrated nutrient management : Combined application of azotobacter (seed treatment@500g/ ha) + 75% recommended N and 100% P&K (125:60:60) is an optimum nutrient combination for obtaining higher fruit yield.

ensuing honeydew production, thus exacerbating crop damage and yield or quality loss. Higher populations of B. tabaci are regularly observed on water-stressed, versus well-watered, cotton plants. In the meantime, B. tabaci that feed on well-watered plants produce more honeydew with higher sugar contents than on drought-stressed cotton, which can aggravate sooty mould issues. Host-plant resistance. The establishment of crop varieties that are resistant to B. tabaci and associated viruses such as tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV, is a preferred solution to minimize whitefly-related damage. The Mi-1 gene, present in many varieties of cultivated tomato and introduced into this plant from its wild relative, S. peruvianum , regulates resistance to B. tabaci , the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae and root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. Physical control. In greenhouse or tunnel systems, nylon screen netting (mesh diameter 0.125 mm) can effectively reduce whitefly infestation levels and yellow sticky cards are routinely used for monitoring purposes though these can also help to lower population levels. Yellow sticky card (24 cm x 20 cm) trap adult whiteflies efficiently when placed vertically among plants at or slightly above canopy level with one card per 3 m to 5 m. Under field conditions, reflective mulches repel whiteflies, oil-coated yellow mulches act as a trap for whiteflies, floating row covers can physically exclude whiteflies during specific stages of the host crop, while a variety of crop and non-crop plants can be established as barrier or (dead-end) trap crops. In addition to the yellow wavelengths that are attractive to whitefly adults, filtration of ultraviolet (UV) light in the range of 280 nm to 380 nm can slow whitefly proliferation. Eliminating the UV portion of the light spectrum interferes with the UV vision of insects and dramatically affects their orientation behavior in the crop. In protected vegetable crops, UV-absorbing polyethylene films, mesh nets or mulches filter most of the UV portion of the light spectrum and significantly reduces infestation pressure of whitefly, aphids, thrips and leafminers. These relatively simple, low-cost approaches can be key in avoiding whitefly-related issues. Biological control. A diverse set of arthropod natural enemies have been recorded and studied in a wide range of cropping systems and geographies, and predation or parasitism consistently feature as the main mortality factors for B. tabaci in cultivated crops. More than 150 arthropod species belonging to nine orders and 31 families prey upon B. tabaci whitefly, most of which are beetles (Coccinellidae), true bugs (Miridae, Anthocoridae), lacewings (Chrysopidae), mites (Phytoseiidae) and spiders (Araneae). Predatory mirids are extensively used in the Mediterranean basin, where Macrolophus caliginosus and Nesidiocoris tenuis are highly abundant in crops where little or no broad-spectrum insecticides are used. In those settings, these predators provide efficient control of whitefly populations and a suite of secondary pests. The release of N. tenuis , at a rate of either 0.1 or four individuals/ plant, can reduce B. tabaci populations by over 90 percent. Some predators however do exhibit zoophytophagous feeding habits and sporadically cause flower abortion and yield losses. The combined release of predators and parasitoids often improves whitefly control, as evidenced by the combined use of M. caliginosus and Eretmocerus mundus in greenhouse tomato greenhouses or simultaneous releases of predaceous mite Amblyseius swirskii and Er. mundus in sweet potato greenhouses and in open field eggplant. 74 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

Recommended variety is MR-6, with a seed rate of 12.5 kg/ha, sown during June-July. Fertilizer application is 100:50:50 kg NPK/ha. Azospirillum biofertilizer is applied. Line sowing is done at a spacing of 30 10 cm. The crop is grown under rainfed conditions with no intercrop. Hand weeding is the primary weed control method. Blast disease is managed by spraying Saaf at 2 g per litre of water. Stem borer is controlled using Coragen at 0.5 g per litre of water.

key predator, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae). Yet, to ensure a broader diffusion of such economic thresholds, careful messaging and empirical validation under variable agroecological and socioeconomic conditions are a must. In addition to the above, recent work has also examined the potential of other monitoring methods such as phototactic electrostatic traps or sticky cards equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision and machine learning have been used to count the number of whitefly individuals on yellow sticky cards. These kinds of methods can eventually enable the development of real-time remote monitoring systems of B. tabaci in field or greenhouse systems. Prevention and control To manage B. tabaci infestations, farmers predominantly rely upon scheduled applications of synthetic insecticides because of their efficacy and convenience. However, chemical pest control causes environmental concerns and also leads to the widespread insecticide resistance development. As of 2024, there are 770 cases of B. tabaci insecticidal resistance worldwide covering no less than 69 different active ingredients. The integrated pest management (IPM) of whitefly calls for use of alternative or complementary methods such as cultural control, resistant host-variety planting, physical control, and biological control using predators and parasitoids (see Figure 8.5 on p. 77). Cultural control. Cultural control involves management practices that make the farming environment less favourable to whitefly reproduction, movement or survival, while favoring its resident natural enemies. Cultural control may rely upon various solutions, including physical barriers or other barriers to prevent the pest colonization, adjusted planting dates, rotation with non-susceptible crops, crop residue destruction and the establishment of resistant crops or cultivars. Though these can be deployed individually, they are ideally used in combination. Diversification measures such as intercropping or the use of trap and barrier crops can lower whitefly population levels to a considerable extent in both field crops and greenhouse settings. When established as a trap crop in cotton or vegetable fields, velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti or Nicotiana benthamiana can simultaneously reduce population levels of whitefly and other insect pests. The latter plant even acts as a dead-end trap crop, proving remarkably attractive and lethal to whiteflies. A scientifically informed adjustment of planting dates can help to avoid peak times of whitefly colonization, and thus prevent pest issues. Early or delayed planting can be particularly effective in areas where whiteflies reproduce rapidly for example, under hot, arid conditions. Highly susceptible crops, such as cucurbits, crucifers and certain solanaceous crops could be planted when whitefly colonization rates are low. Crop sanitation equally plays a central part in whitefly management. In cotton systems, infected plants should be destroyed because B. tabaci can continue to build up for six weeks after final irrigation and even defoliation. Crop residues, which harbour whitefly and virus inoculum, should then be destroyed shortly after the final harvest. Further, susceptible crops should not be planted near infestation sources. It is recommended to plant whitefly-susceptible crops (e.g. cotton) at least 0.751 km upwind from other key host crops or weed species that regularly harbour B. tabaci . Lastly, water and fertilizer management play important roles in whitefly management. Overuse of nitrogen fertilizer can increase whitefly abundance and the 73 8. BEMISIA TABACI WHITEFLY

Farmers: Azotobacter-based biofertilizers improve soil fertility, enhance nutrient uptake, and promote sustainable agriculture practices. Farmers can benefit

por SS Farhan Â· 2025 â€” These bacteria could greatly improve the growth and productivity of crops, enhancing a large percentage of plant length and the amount of nitrogen absorbed when

Research on _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in crop production has shown its importance in improving plant nutrition and amelioration of soil fertility (Kurrey et al., 2018). The scope of utilizing _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in research experiments as microbial inoculant through release of growth substances and their impact on the plant has markedly improved crop production in agriculture (Gothandapani et al., 2017). Bacterial genus _Azotobacter_ is reported to synthesize auxins, cytokinins, and GA-like substances that have been found to be directly associated with improved plant growth (Wani et al., 2013). Owing to its ability to improve plant health through nitrogen fixation, growth hormone production, phosphate solubilization, plant disease management and reclamation of better soil health, _Azotobacter_ is one of the best options to be used as biofertilizer for eco-friendly and sustainable crop production.

Azotobacter-based biofertilizers, in particular, offer a dual advantage: enriching soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation while mitigating

The market is projected to reach a value of $2.5 billion by 2025, expanding at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8% from 2025 to 2033.

Detection and inspection Monitoring. Yellow sticky traps are a useful tool for monitoring B. tabaci . For example, 75 yellow sticky cards (24 cm x 20 cm) can be placed at canopy height in one hectare of crop field, at equal distances. Using this monitoring method, numerical thresholds can be defined for different management tactics: (i) at 0.250.5 adults/cm , 2 biological control measures, such as the release of natural enemies, should be taken; (ii) at 34 adult/cm , chemical control measures or biopesticide spray applications 2 are recommended to prevent whitefly outbreaks. Sampling via the leaf-turn method is also commonly used for whitefly monitoring and decision-making. Because the within-plant distribution pattern of whiteflies varies with plant phenology, and whitefly or plant species, sampling protocols must take these and, potentially, other factors into account. Accordingly, the exact whitefly infestation levels at which management intervention is warranted can vary widely. Economic thresholds and action thresholds are prime decision criteria for farmers and pest management professionals, applicable to all pests, crops and farming contexts. In general, thresholds are experimentally defined as the pest infestation level at which curative control measures should be deployed (while accounting for a time lag to yield impact) to avoid significant crop damage. Economic thresholds are based upon an economic injury level (EIL) and thus, involve rigorous economic criteria, for example, tabulated input expenditure, labour costs, and value of the harvested produce. Under specific market and environmental conditions in China, an EIL was established for whitefly on cucumber plant at 18 adults per plant at the four-leaf stage and, on greenhouse tomato, at 13.6 adults per 100 leaves. On cabbage, thresholds have been set at 6.0 to 6.8 adults per plant in the seedling stage and at 2.1 to 3.8 adults per plant in the rosette stage. More pragmatic thresholds with a far weaker economic foundation have been defined in some Chinese vegetable crops. These experimental action thresholds specify that natural enemy releases should be done once adult whiteflies reach densities of 0.5 to 2 adults/leaf, while higher densities (i.e. five to six adults/leaf) warrant the use of environmentally friendly insecticides or biopesticides. This has been taken a step further in European greenhouse systems, where simulation models are used to define the release size and timing of predators and parasitoids in order to keep whitefly numbers below EIL. Thresholds have also been defined that concurrently account for the actual population densities of whitefly and a 72 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

Plant movement thus facilitates the spread of insecticide resistance genes, leading to increases in the use of chemicals and, in turn, adverse impacts on the environment.

Recommended variety is MR-6, with a seed rate of 12.5 kg/ha, sown during June-July. Fertilizer application is 100:50:50 kg NPK/ha. Azospirillum biofertilizer is applied. Line sowing is done at a spacing of 30 10 cm. The crop is grown under rainfed conditions with no intercrop. Hand weeding is the primary weed control method. Blast disease is managed by spraying Saaf at 2 g per litre of water. Stem borer is controlled using Coragen at 0.5 g per litre of water.

ensuing honeydew production, thus exacerbating crop damage and yield or quality loss. Higher populations of B. tabaci are regularly observed on water-stressed, versus well-watered, cotton plants. In the meantime, B. tabaci that feed on well-watered plants produce more honeydew with higher sugar contents than on drought-stressed cotton, which can aggravate sooty mould issues. Host-plant resistance. The establishment of crop varieties that are resistant to B. tabaci and associated viruses such as tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV, is a preferred solution to minimize whitefly-related damage. The Mi-1 gene, present in many varieties of cultivated tomato and introduced into this plant from its wild relative, S. peruvianum , regulates resistance to B. tabaci , the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae and root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. Physical control. In greenhouse or tunnel systems, nylon screen netting (mesh diameter 0.125 mm) can effectively reduce whitefly infestation levels and yellow sticky cards are routinely used for monitoring purposes though these can also help to lower population levels. Yellow sticky card (24 cm x 20 cm) trap adult whiteflies efficiently when placed vertically among plants at or slightly above canopy level with one card per 3 m to 5 m. Under field conditions, reflective mulches repel whiteflies, oil-coated yellow mulches act as a trap for whiteflies, floating row covers can physically exclude whiteflies during specific stages of the host crop, while a variety of crop and non-crop plants can be established as barrier or (dead-end) trap crops. In addition to the yellow wavelengths that are attractive to whitefly adults, filtration of ultraviolet (UV) light in the range of 280 nm to 380 nm can slow whitefly proliferation. Eliminating the UV portion of the light spectrum interferes with the UV vision of insects and dramatically affects their orientation behavior in the crop. In protected vegetable crops, UV-absorbing polyethylene films, mesh nets or mulches filter most of the UV portion of the light spectrum and significantly reduces infestation pressure of whitefly, aphids, thrips and leafminers. These relatively simple, low-cost approaches can be key in avoiding whitefly-related issues. Biological control. A diverse set of arthropod natural enemies have been recorded and studied in a wide range of cropping systems and geographies, and predation or parasitism consistently feature as the main mortality factors for B. tabaci in cultivated crops. More than 150 arthropod species belonging to nine orders and 31 families prey upon B. tabaci whitefly, most of which are beetles (Coccinellidae), true bugs (Miridae, Anthocoridae), lacewings (Chrysopidae), mites (Phytoseiidae) and spiders (Araneae). Predatory mirids are extensively used in the Mediterranean basin, where Macrolophus caliginosus and Nesidiocoris tenuis are highly abundant in crops where little or no broad-spectrum insecticides are used. In those settings, these predators provide efficient control of whitefly populations and a suite of secondary pests. The release of N. tenuis , at a rate of either 0.1 or four individuals/ plant, can reduce B. tabaci populations by over 90 percent. Some predators however do exhibit zoophytophagous feeding habits and sporadically cause flower abortion and yield losses. The combined release of predators and parasitoids often improves whitefly control, as evidenced by the combined use of M. caliginosus and Eretmocerus mundus in greenhouse tomato greenhouses or simultaneous releases of predaceous mite Amblyseius swirskii and Er. mundus in sweet potato greenhouses and in open field eggplant. 74 Guidance on integrated pest management for the worlds major crop pests and diseases

 Streptocycline (0.1 g), copper sulfate (0.1 g), and biofertilizer Azospirillum at 400 g per 25 kg seed mixed with 50 g of jaggery. Seedlings may also undergo root dipping in Carbendazim solution before transplanting. Transplanting is done either manually or with machines, maintaining a spacing of 20 by 10 cm or 8 by 4 inches depending on the practice. Weed management begins with pre-emergent application of Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1 L/acre or Pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10% WP at 200 g per hectare, followed by post-emergent spraying of Bispyribac sodium 10 SC at 100 ml per acre. Paddy crops can be rainfed, especially for varieties like MO-4 and Tunga, while others require irrigation during critical stages such as tillering, panicle initiation, lowering, and grain illing. Additional foliar nutrient application includes potassium nitrate at 10 grams per litre of water at 60 days after transplanting, along with nano urea, nano DAP, and micronutrient sprays such as Samriddhi. Zinc sulphate may also be sprayed at 10 g per litre. Pest management involves several strategies. For stem borer control, clipping the terminal leaf during transplanting is recommended, along with spraying Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 2 ml per litre or applying Fipronil 0.3G at 10 kg per acre and using pheromone traps at the rate of 7 per acre. Leaf folder can be managed with Flubendiamide 48 SC at 0.08 ml per litre, while gall midge is controlled with Chlorpyriphos sprays. For brown plant hopper and case worm, soil application of Carbofuran granules (10% at 5 kg or 3G at 8 kg per acre) is effective. In terms of disease management, blast is addressed through seed treatment with Carbendazim and spraying Tricyclazole 75 WP at 0.6 to 1 g per litre or Propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml per litre. Brown leaf spot is managed by spraying Carbendazim at 1 g per litre. Bacterial blight is controlled using a combination of copper oxychloride (50 g) and Streptocycline (25 g) per acre.

Research on _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in crop production has shown its importance in improving plant nutrition and amelioration of soil fertility (Kurrey et al., 2018). The scope of utilizing _Azotobacter chroococcum_ in research experiments as microbial inoculant through release of growth substances and their impact on the plant has markedly improved crop production in agriculture (Gothandapani et al., 2017). Bacterial genus _Azotobacter_ is reported to synthesize auxins, cytokinins, and GA-like substances that have been found to be directly associated with improved plant growth (Wani et al., 2013). Owing to its ability to improve plant health through nitrogen fixation, growth hormone production, phosphate solubilization, plant disease management and reclamation of better soil health, _Azotobacter_ is one of the best options to be used as biofertilizer for eco-friendly and sustainable crop production.
